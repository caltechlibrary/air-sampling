Caltech, in partnership with Altadena and Pasadena community members, is establishing a dense air quality monitoring network focused on measuring airborne dust and ash in and around the burned areas of Altadena. A total of 25 sensors will be set up across Altadena.

**Timeline**:

Caltech and the sensor vendor, QuantAQ, are rapidly rolling out the network. Establishing the network quickly is crucial, as phase two of the cleanup is already underway and is expected to continue through next fall. As of February 27, 2025, we have set up 6 out of 25 sensors. 

This website aims to provide the community with easy-to-interpret information on airborne dust. These independent air quality observations will build community confidence that good air quality is being maintained during the cleanup activities and provide the AQMD, FEMA, EPA, and the Army Corp of Engineers with data to evaluate their dust mitigation activities.
